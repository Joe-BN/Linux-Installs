This is a collection of my own personal notes to self for future reference interms of things that I encountered while working on this system

# Fonts
fonts are stored in the '/usr/share/fonts' directory
use commands:
    $ fc-list  -> to see the fonts that are installed
    $ fc-cache -f -v  -> to force refreshing the font cache



# Ports
A way to check the ports that are in use are the respective activity using them
use the command:("ss" is often pre-installed in most linux distros)
    $ sudo ss -tlnp
    $ sudo lsof -i -P -n  -> to get the details of open files by said ports
    
    If you want sth a bit easier on the eyes, just like "ss" you can use netstat (part of net-tools)
    {actually older than "ss"}
        Install net-tools: 
            $ sudo apt-get install net-tools
        run netstat:
            $ sudo netstat -tlnp
    [WARNING! "netstat" is depricated and was replaces by "ss"]



# Github SSH
How to set up the github ssh key for my ubuntu machine
Generate the ssh key in terminal:
    $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
Copy the ssh public key:
	$ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub (assuming you used the default location to store your ssh key)
Edit the ssh config file to set the location for github to refer to
    $ nano ~/.ssh/config
        and add this line:
    Host github.com
        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
Try connecting to github using ssh:
    $ ssh -T git@github.com
    {
        First time connecting will require your to respond with a full on "yes" to confrim and add github to ssh clients on your machine
    }
NOTE:
    The ssh Public key is what is added to your 'https://github.com/settings/keys', make sure to keep the private key safe at all times




# Creating and using a variable in terminal
Generally:
    $ My_variable=My_value
    $ echo $My_variable

more specifically for moving information around:
    $ my_variable=$(cat <file_name> | grep <criteria>)
    $ echo my_variable
        or sth like:
    $ sudo apt-get install $my_variable
